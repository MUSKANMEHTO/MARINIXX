🚀 Project Overview

MATRIX (Marine AI Technology for Research & eXploration) is an advanced AI-driven unified data platform developed to integrate and analyze oceanographic, fisheries, and molecular biodiversity data (eDNA). This project is developed as a Software-based innovation for ASIH / SIH 2025 under the guidance of the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES).

MATRIX aims to bridge the gap between raw marine data and actionable scientific insights using Artificial Intelligence, real-time monitoring, and interactive visualization tools.
